I worked part time alongside my studies until May, and then continued as an intern during summer. My tasks naturally included a lot of bug squashing and refactoring, but also implementing new features and creating internal tools for efficiency. An example is making a Slack bot to add previews for links to the Strise products. You can read about that and more in a blogpost I wrote for Strise at this link.",
