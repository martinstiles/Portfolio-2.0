For my part, the main focus of this project was to refresh knowledge of common pathfinding algorithms, while getting some experience with basic visualization in React. All logic is written in Javascript.",

            "description": "This is oretty much the same as the pathfinding visualizer, except with clustering algorithms. Visualizing the algorithms while they were running turned out to be harder than expected, and thus I've currently set everything to run instantly. I might update this with more algorithms and actual visualization later.",
